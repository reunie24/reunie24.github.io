    <h1>My story</h1>
    <p> <i>"For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future". Jeremiah 29:11</i> <br> <br>
      Welcome to the Nessa Nurtures blog! Thank You so much for taking the time out to visit my website. I am Vanessa, a young woman of God. I rededicated my life back to Christ in January and it literally has been the best decision I've made thus
      far and the best decision I'll ever make! It hasn’t been the easiest journey, but it sure will be worth it. <br>
      Throughout my Christian walk, I started to journal and write a whole lot (I still do) and eventually I felt led to start a blog for young Christian ladies. Not only do I have a blog, but I have a YouTube Channel as well.<br>
      The purpose of the "Nessaa Nurtures" Blog & YouTube channel is to push you back further to Christ, to push you back into His presence. I want to be able to help a Sista out that may be struggling or simply be an encouragement whether that be
      through sharing my testimony and or personal experiences. I always like to say, my story is not for me, it's to help someone else, give them hope, and empower them at the end of the day. I pray you all get something out of the blogs I'll post
      and leave feeling like the Queens you already are! Jesus loves you! <br><br>
      Love, <br>
      Nessaa
